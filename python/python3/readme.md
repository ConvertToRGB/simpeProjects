### upperDecor.py

Was created for faster stylizing `*.md` file. It allow user to set his text decorator when asked, for example: 
`!!!mydecorator!!!`
and make all income text in caps. Then user type string what requires decoration, for example:
`my_string`
The result string will be this: 
`!!!mydecorator!!!MY_STRING!!!mydecorator!!!`
This string then is copied to clipboard and then program waits for the next string. Two command are allowed:

- 'stop' - stop program
- 'change' - change decoration string
