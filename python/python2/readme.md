<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td data-nmove="1" class="chessHistoryActiveMove">e4</td>
		<td data-nmove="2" class="">e5</td>
	</tr>

For example you have some pictures and they have random names [`banana.png`, `apple.jpg`, `nebula.jpg`] and you need to create sequence like [`pic_001.png`,`pic_002.jpg`, `pic_003.jpg`] then this script can help with this task. You must set new name and you can set padding (by default padding=3).
